👋 Hello! I'm K.V.L.Praphulla, a passionate computer science student.
🎓 About Me:
I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
Always eager to learn and explore new technologies, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set.

💻 Tech Stack:
Proficient in languages such as Python, Java, C, and JavaScript.
Familiar with frameworks like Html,Css
Comfortable working with databases such as MySQL.

🚀 Projects:

-Multi-Trait Multi-Environment Genomic Prediction for End-Use Quality Traits in Winter wheat: 
 Implemented a Random Forest model to predict end-use quality traits in winter wheat using  multi-trait multi- environment genomic data. 
 Collected and preprocessed genomic and phenotypic data acrossdiverse environments and genotypes. 
 Employed feature selection and encoding techniques to prepare genomic features for model training.
 Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and traits
 -Drum-Kit:
 I have implemented this challenge using Html,css and JavaScript, where the code works when we tap the respective keys of the instruments or just by clicking the 
 button,there comes an audio of the instrument playing.
